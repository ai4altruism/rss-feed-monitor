# RSS Feed Monitor Enhancement Plans

## Current Status: Option 1 Implemented ✅

**Completed**: Enhanced FILTER_PROMPT for better natural disaster filtering

### What Was Done
- Updated FILTER_PROMPT to target significant natural disasters only
- Added specific criteria (6.0+ magnitude earthquakes, widespread damage requirements)
- Excluded transportation accidents and minor incidents
- Required location information in articles
- Attempted to exclude paywall content
- Removed unused docker-compose.yml
- Updated CLAUDE.md with direct docker commands

## Next Enhancement Options

### Option 2: Enhanced Filtering Logic (Moderate Complexity)

**Objective**: Improve filtering accuracy beyond just prompt improvements

**Changes**:
- Modify `src/llm_filter.py` to add structured filtering stages
- Add location extraction validation in the filter
- Implement paywall detection (check for subscription keywords)
- Add disaster impact/scale assessment
- Use more structured prompting for better accuracy

**Benefits**:
- More reliable filtering decisions
- Better paywall detection
- Validation that location information exists
- Impact-based filtering for significance

**Effort**: Medium (2-3 files modified)

### Option 3: Two-Stage Filtering Pipeline (Complex)

**Objective**: Create a multi-stage filtering system for maximum accuracy

**Changes**:
- Add pre-filtering stage for basic disaster type detection
- Implement dedicated location extraction and validation
- Create separate paywall detection module
- Add impact assessment scoring system
- Implement confidence scoring for filtering decisions

**Benefits**:
- Highest filtering accuracy
- Detailed logging of filtering decisions
- Configurable filtering stages
- Better handling of edge cases

**Effort**: High (4-5 files modified, new modules)

### Option 4: Enhanced Summarization (Most Complex)

**Objective**: Ensure summaries always contain proper location information

**Changes**:
- Modify `src/summarizer.py` to enforce location requirements
- Add location standardization (city/state for US, country for international)
- Implement location validation and correction
- Filter out paywall articles during summarization
- Add disaster impact metrics to summaries

**Benefits**:
- Guaranteed location information in all summaries
- Standardized location formatting
- Impact-based summary prioritization
- Better user experience

**Effort**: High (major summarization logic changes)

## Implementation Recommendations

### Phase 1 (Current): Option 1 - Prompt Enhancement ✅
- **Status**: Complete
- **Monitor results**: Check filtering effectiveness over 1-2 weeks

### Phase 2 (Recommended Next): Option 2 - Enhanced Filtering Logic
- **When**: After evaluating Option 1 results
- **Focus**: Improve filtering accuracy and paywall detection
- **Risk**: Low - builds on existing filtering system

### Phase 3 (Future): Option 3 or 4 based on needs
- **When**: If Option 2 results are insufficient
- **Decision factors**: 
  - Filter accuracy from Option 2
  - User feedback on location information
  - Paywall article frequency

## Monitoring & Evaluation

### Key Metrics to Track
1. **Filter Effectiveness**: Articles passed vs rejected
2. **Location Information**: Percentage of summaries with proper location data
3. **Paywall Articles**: Number of paywall articles still getting through
4. **User Feedback**: Relevance of stories delivered to Slack

### Success Criteria
- >90% of articles are significant natural disasters
- >95% of summaries contain location information
- <5% paywall articles in final output
- Positive user feedback on story relevance

## Technical Notes

### Current Architecture Strengths
- Clean separation of filtering and summarization
- Easy to modify individual components
- Good error handling and logging

### Areas for Future Enhancement
- Batch processing for better API efficiency
- Caching of filtering decisions
- Machine learning for filtering improvement
- Integration with disaster severity databases
